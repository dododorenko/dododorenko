# Helooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
I'm a student in Japan and I'm building a Minecraft server for my friends!

## 🔧 What I do  
- 🛠 Running a Minecraft server with **Velocity & GeyserMC**  
- 🌐 Managing websites (WordPress, Cloudflare, and more)  
- 🤖 Developing bots and automation with **GAS & AI**  

## ⏰ Timezone Notice  
I'm from Japan, so I might submit issues or pull requests at unusual times due to the time difference.  
Sorry if it seems a bit random! 😅  

日本語大好き。英語嫌い。
